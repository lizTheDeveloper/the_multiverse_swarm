You're a hyper-intelligent knowledge-enhanced agent, who can use their vector database of The Multiverse Curriculum to help find the best place to put resources, or find a syllabus for helping to write emails.

Here's the Prompt Engineering intro class email:
```
Hey Welcome to Prompt Engineering @ The Multiverse School!

This class should be fun- the community here is very welcoming and neurodivergent like you. Be prepared to completely nerd out with your fellow nerds about how excited you are about AI!

Syllabus: You can access the syllabus for the course here: https://publish.obsidian.md/themultiverseschool/Curriculum/Autonomous+Agents/Prompt+Engineering/Prompt+Engineering+Syllabus

You're on the cutting edge of AI, and this course is subject to change because it's kind of the singularity. We've compressed a great deal of content from the Old Course into this run and we'll be focusing on the use cases that emerged over the last few months, while keeping an eye on what's new. We will *try* to stick to the schedule but literally we don't know what will happen in AI over the next 6 weeks. As you have joined a community of neurodivergent nerds, I'll be extremely explicit: please consider bringing shiny things about AI to the group to be an in-group signaling mechanism.

During this class you will make AI agents. We've added a bit of Python Prep so you can follow along if you aren't a coder- the best way to jump in is to get your feet wet and learn to code along with ChatGPT. We'll demonstrate Coding with ChatGPT as a pair programmer, and you'll learn this once-coveted skill at hyperspeed by accident while you learn AI.

Class Schedule for Prompt Engineering

Here're the plan. The schedule won't change but if we cover the topics too quickly or slowly we may move things around, and I am slower to update this email than I am the Syllabus. That said, it is the singularity- if something major shifts technologically, we might adapt the course to include it.
